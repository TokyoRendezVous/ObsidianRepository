The base unit of memory is a byte.
Memory is represented as a block of bytes.

1 byte = 8 bit

作为接近汇编的低级语言，C语言为开发者提供了几乎不受限的内存访问权限。

Each byte of memory has its own address that is used to store data.
This address is usually enumerated using the hexadecimal number system.

int -> 4 bytes of memory
short int -> 2 bytes
double -> 8 bytes 
char -> 1 byte
